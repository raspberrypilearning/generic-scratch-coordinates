### Scratch coordinates

+ In Scratch, the position `x:0, y:0` is the centre of the Stage.

    A position like `x:-200, y:-100` is towards the bottom left of the Stage, and a position like `x:200, y:100` is near the top right.

+ You can see this for yourself by adding the **xy-grid** backdrop to your project.

+ To find out coordinates of a specific position on the Stage, move your mouse pointer to it and check the readings below the bottom right corner of the Stage.
