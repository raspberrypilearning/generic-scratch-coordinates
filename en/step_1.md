### Scratch Coordinates

+ In Scratch, the stage position x:0, y:0 is the centre of the stage.

    A position like x:-200 y:-100 is towards the bottom-left of the stage, and a position like x:200 y:100 is near the top-right.

+ You can see this for yourself by adding the 'xy-grid' backdrop to your project.

+ To find out a position on the stage, move your mouse pointer and see the readings change under the bottom-right of the stage.
