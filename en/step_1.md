### Scratch coordinates

+ In Scratch, the stage position `x:0 y:0` is the centre of the Stage.

    A position like `x:-200 y:-100` is towards the bottom left of the Stage, and a position like `x:200 y:100` is near the top right.

+ You can see this for yourself by adding the **xy-grid** backdrop to your project.

+ To find out a position on the Stage, move your mouse pointer and see the readings change below the bottom right corner of the Stage.
